My name is Matthew Kowal, welcome to my website (and blog - link at the top). I am a PhD student at [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/) in Toronto, Canada, supervised by [Dr. Kosta Derpanis](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~kosta/). My research focuses on how we can better understand the world around us using neural networks and unlabelled data. In particular, I am currently working on designing interpretable deep learning algorithms for video-based computer vision algorithms. I also write blog posts every so often talking about things related to my research.
